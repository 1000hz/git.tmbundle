Currently, the most feature complete version of the Git text-mate bundle

Fixes / New Features
* Overhaul on the "Git Commit" dialog. All sorts of bugs fixed. 
* Deleted files show up as status "Deleted" rather than modified. 
* Selecting them deletes them, (instead of throwing an error). 
* Selecting a non-tracked files will add it, then commit it.
* It just does what makes sense. 
* Works better than the subversion commit dialog now, in my opinion.

* Edit conflicts using FileMerge command

* Diff window has pretty colors!

* Push / Pull commands

* Diff between revisions, using the revision select dialog (borrowed from the subversion bundle)

* Open previous revision of file (using the same, nifty dialog)

* Interactive annotation-browser

* Log shows a diff - ability to show/hide diffs for logs

* Push/Pull/Commit shows a log with diffs of everything committed/pushed/pulled, to make it easier to monitor your repository.

* Many other miscellaneous fixes.
