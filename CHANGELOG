Release 1.3.1 [2008-04-07]

Release 1.2.0 [2008-04-03]

Features:
- Submodule support - Add and list submodules.  Automatically update them when switching branches or pulling.
  - Automatically check Submodules when switching branches or pulling (switching to a branch pointing to an older version of a submodule automatically checks the submodule out to that version)
  - Prevent accidental commit-loss by not allow commits while not on branch.
- Stale remote branches are now pruned via "Fetch".
- Push now only pushes the current branch (it's surprising behavior to push "master" and see a rejection notice for "release").  
- If the branch does not exist remotely, it gets created.

Fixes: 
- Much internal refactoring and cleaning up code base
- tell textmate to rescan after a svn rebase
- Applied Jiho's patch for the git commit message language.  Thanks, Jiho!
- tell textmate to rescan the project after a pull is completed
- Fixed misleading output from pull/fetch commands.  show "Output" instead of "Error"

Release 1.1.4 [2008-03-17]

Release 1.1.3 [2008-03-12]
 - prompt to merge from local or remote branches
 - path for project home now showing as "./" in commit dialog.  Path always displays relative to project_path, if it exists.

Release 1.1.1 [2008-03-10]
 - Bugfix - merge command was breaking when trying to show links to conflicted files

 - "Working directory is clean" message disappeared.  Restored 
 - Merge parser was not pcking up on delete/modify merge conflicts.  fixed
 - merge command was a bit over-eager.  No longer auto opens conflicted files.
