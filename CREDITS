CREDITS / PATCHES / THANKS
----------------------------
The git bundle wouldn't be possible without the contributions of the following fine gentlemen:

Allan Odgaard - For starting the bundle and getting the ball rolling.  Also, for creating TextMate!

Johan SÃ¸rensen - Contributing the CSS styling.  He made gitorious look so sexy I just couldn't think of a better design to implement for the bundle, so he's generously allowed me to utilize it.

Tommi Asiala - README file submission

Lawrence Pit - Performance Enhancements
