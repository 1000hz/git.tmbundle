This is a road map to experimental branches and what they should do once they're done. 	

Anyone's encouraged to add to this list or take an idea and turn it into a branch or work on an existing experimental branch. 
I think it's a good idea to keep features in development in separate branches until they're ready to be merged into master. 

Branches in progress

experimental_gitk -- 
	try to implement invoking gitk from the bundle. 
	doesnt really work now because it the bundle beachballs when called from the menu. 
	
Ideas yet to be branched (but they're on my mind of things to do when I get to it)

	git-gui --
		tim was running into the same problem I did with beachballing
	cherry-picking -- 
		pick a SHA ref and merge the commit associated with it from one branch to another
	amending and signing off on commits
	setting up the .gitignore file for a standard rails project
