This is a road map to experimental branches and what they should do once they're done. 	

experimental_gitk -- 
	try to implement invoking gitk from the bundle. 
	doesnt really work now because it the bundle beachballs when called from the menu. 

experimental_gitify -- 
	planned feature to move creation of a git repository from the command line by calling git-init to a bundle menu item
